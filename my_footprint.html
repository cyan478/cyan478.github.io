			<h1> Background </h1>

			<p><a href=http://turninggreen.org>Turning Green</a> is a global student-led movement devoted to inform, inspire, and mobilize a global network of student leaders for sustainable change in their lives, school campuses, and local communities. This summer, I was the designer of the remote student team <a href=http://turninggreen.org/programs/project-green-challenge/>Project Green Challenge</a> to work on My Footprint, a web application that allows users to keep track of their carbon footprint and engage with 14 different environmental themes. Themes include water, food, and plastic waste, and each theme has a number of challenges in which users can set an amount of time to commit to. Challenge examples include "How long can I go without accepting a plastic bag from a grocery store?" and "How can I make my own toothpaste to prevent purchasing new plastic tubed ones?" </p>

			<h2> Features </h2>

			<p> - Provide different challenges on how to reduce carbon footprint. <br>
				- Allow users to see their metrics and the impact they bring to the environment through the challenges they commit to. <br>
				- Users will be more informed across all available themes, as they are required to watch a short clip about the theme before accessing the challenges. <br>
				- Challenges are not static, and new ones will be added to the queue. <br>
			- There will be "Tip of the Day" notifications that ring in new tips on how to be more environmentally conscious. </p>

			<h2> Workflow and Communication </h2>

			<p>I worked extremely closely with the Project Manager Jenny Fang through one-on-one weekly Google Hangout calls. At the start of these sessions, I walked Jenny through my design sketches and mockups, and she provided crucial critiques that allowed me to reiterate and refine upon my designs as a first time Product Designer. As the PM, Jenny communicated her vision for the pages in the app, and I provided the technical and design structural feedback and steps to reach our desired goal.</p> 

			<p>On Wednesdays, I met with the backend and frontend engineering leads, in which I walked them through my hi-fidelity prototypes for different pages.</p>

			<h1> App Development Process</h1>

			<h2> Agile Development </h2>

			<p>The team set up an Asana account platform, a project management software that streamlined communication between the PM, engineering team, and the designer. </p>
