			<h1> Background </h1>

			<h2> Coding Instructor Role Overview </h2>

			<p> In Summer 2018, I was a Coding Instructor under iDTech Camps&mdash;Alexa Caf&eacute; on New York University (NYU) campus for five weeks. For each week, I taught computer programming and computer science concepts to a new cohort of 8-10 middle school girls, aged 10-15. Over the summer, I personally instructed and mentored around 50 to 70 girls, including cross-courses! One of the greatest things about Alexa Caf&eacute; is that it's a summer coding camp specifically for girls, meaning female empowerment in STEM and an amazing opportunity for me to mentor and inspire over 50 talented female programmers.</p>

			<p> As a coding instructor at Alexa Caf&eacute;, I had the liberty to design the course curriculum and shape my half of the classroom space however I saw fit. My teaching schedule was as follows, alternating courses each week:</p>

			<p>1. Robo Squad: Robotics and AI with Your Own Cozmo (Python, Cozmo SDK)<br>

			2. Code Caf&eacute;: Development with Java/Game Station: Code Games with Java (Java, Processing) <br>

			<p>Usually my campers stay for one week of day camp, in which they learn basic to complex coding concepts to create a fully-working final project by Friday's showcase to parents and guardians. In one week, I covered material in primitive data types, system input/output, and/or/not, for and while loops, arrays, classes and objects. Complementary material also included what a console is, how to to debug, and truth tables. For the Python course, Cozmo SDK/API, reading documentation, and testing were included in the curriculum. For the Java course, learning animation and Processing was available for advanced students. </p>

			<h2> Okay, what about Design Thinking? </h2>

			<p>With so much material to cover in simply five days, each class session was valuable and fundamental for campers to truly grasp new concepts and watch their code come to life! But, some of the hurdles that I immediately noticed on my first day on the job were that 10 students learned at 3 relatively different paces (beginner, intermediate, advanced), technical difficulties with the projector's sound was a thing, and it was really hard and draining to constantly debug 10 students' personal code during independent work sessions. There is a lot of power to designing course curriculum and classroom space, and I iterated on improving class flow week after week, based on my teaching experience on the week before. </p>

			<h1> Designing... </h1>

			<h2>Curriculum Worksheets</h2>

			<p>talk about worksheets</p>

			<h2>Classroom Setup</h2>

			<p>talk about classroom</p>

			<p>talk about whiteboarding</p>

			<h2>Different Learning Approaches</h2>

			<p>talk about how students learn at different paces, and how to describe a concept in a new light</p>

			<h2>Important Discussions</h2>
			<p>female empowerment, tech ethics</p>

			<h1>Final Takeaways</h1>

			<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

			<p>conversing with 10-15 year olds</p>
			<p>whiteboard coding</p>
			<p>learned a thing of two about Cozmo and SDKs</p>
			<p>working with different learning paces and approaches</p>
			<p>company team support</p>


			<h2>Going Forward</h2>
			
			<p>thrive in team based community</p>
			<p>fast diagraming on whiteboard or paper</p>
			<p>quick to observe confusion or miscommunication</p>
			<p>communicating ideas and getting others up to speed with various approaches to explaining</p>
